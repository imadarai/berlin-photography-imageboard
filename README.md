Project features an infinite scroll that also indicates if there are no more images.  
The user can also upload their own picture by clicking on the plus button in the bottom right corner. The user will need to enter their name, the title and the description of the picture. The picture will be added to the gallery and shown on the top without page being refreshed.
When not in use, the uploader remains hidden.
When clicking on the image a pop-up with a bigger version of the image, all relevant information and the comments is shown.
